## 1. Terminal

Access your Google colab terminal [here](https://colab.research.google.com/) for details on how to use it is explained here:[Google colab terminal](https://youtu.be/pvUU3eVPU5U)

Create a notebook and name it `Bioigenome_workshop` this will ensure you don't loose you data when you close your session.

## 2. Conda and Bioinformatics Tools Installation

Clone this repository by copying and pasting the command on the terminal you accessed above.

```
git clone https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Training-Materials/East-Africa-BioGenome-Bioinformatics-Practical-Workshop.git
```
Change directory to the repo cloned above

```
cd East-Africa-BioGenome-Bioinformatics-Practical-Workshop
```
The command below executes a script which downloads conda, creates the required environments and installs the required tools. Copy and paste the command, relax and watch the magic happen !!! ðŸ˜‚

```
bash Installation_scripts/quick_install.sh
```
