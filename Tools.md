```
git clone https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Training-Materials/East-Africa-BioGenome-Bioinformatics-Practical-Workshop.git
```
Change directory to the repo cloned above

```
cd East-Africa-BioGenome-Bioinformatics-Practical-Workshop
```

## 4. Install required tools

The command below runs a script that creates the required environments and installs the required tools. Copy and paste the command, relax and watch the magic happen !!! ðŸ˜‚

```
