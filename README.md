Welcome to the Bioinformatics training. In this training, we will focus on the essential foundations you need to begin analyzing your data and to build a strong path toward becoming a proficient bioinformatician.

## Motivation
Bioinformatics is at the heart of modern biology, unlocking insights from biological data. Whether you're working with DNA sequences, gene expression profiles, or microbial communities, the ability to analyze and interpret data is essential. This training is designed to give you a practical foundation, enough to get started, explore confidently, and grow into a skilled bioinformatician. 

All you need is a stable internet connection and the curiosity to dive into the command line, experiment with tools, and learn by doing.

### Install/Set-up Linux terminal

We shall be using the terminal on google-colab for uniformity. To set it up go through this: [Linux terminal set-up](Linux.md) 

### Install Analysis tools

There are several tools needed to complete the workshop. I have automated the installation of all these tools inorder to save on time as well as avoid system based incompatibilities. Follow this [tutorial](Tools.md) to install the tools and
