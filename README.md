Welcome to the Bioinformatics training. In this training, we will focus on the essential foundations you need to begin analyzing your data and to build a strong path toward becoming a proficient bioinformatician.

## Motivation
Bioinformatics is at the heart of modern biology, unlocking insights from biological data. Whether you're working with DNA sequences, gene expression profiles, or microbial communities, the ability to analyze and 
interpret data is essential. This training is designed to give you a practical foundation, enough to get started, explore confidently, and grow into a skilled bioinformatician. 

All you need is a stable internet connection and the curiosity to dive into the command line, experiment with tools, and learn by doing. 

**Letâ€™s get started! ðŸš€**

## Linux
Linux is a Unix-like operating system built around the Linux kernel, which was developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. 
Unlike traditional Unix, Linux is:
- Free and open-source
- Developed by a global community
- Widely used across servers, desktops, mobile devices (Android), supercomputers, and embedded systems
Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and CentOS. It was originally created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.

# Architecture Overview:

In this training, our goal is to learn essential Linux commands through the terminal, which is powered by the shell. To keep things simple and accessible, we will use Google Colab as an alternative to a full Linux installation. This approach saves time and avoids the technical complexity of setting up a complete Linux operating system.

Additionally, other options for accessing a Linux terminal include tools like Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and virtual machinesâ€”but for the scope of this training, Google Colab provides a convenient and efficient environment to get started quickly. Follow this link to set up your Google Colab Terminal in readiness for the workshop. [Setting-up Terminal on Google colab](https://youtu.be/pvUU3eVPU5U).
